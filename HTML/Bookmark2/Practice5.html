        <p>AVUL PAKIR JAINULABDEEN ABDUL KALAM has come to personally
            represent to many of his countrymen the best aspects of Indian life. Born in
            1931, the son of a little educated boatowner in Rameswaram, Tamilnadu, he had
            an unparalleled career as a defence scientist, culminating in the highest civilian
            award of India, the Bharat Ratna.</p>

        <p>As chief of the countrys defence research and development programme, Kalam
            demonstrated the great potential for dynamism and innovation that existed in
            seemingly moribund research establishments. This is the story of Kalams rise
            from obscurity and his personal and professional struggles, as well as the
            story of Agni, Prithvi, Akash, Trishul and Nag - missiles that have become
            household names in India and that have raised the nation to the level of a
            missile power of international recokoning.</p>

        <p>At the same time as he has helped create Indias awesome weaponry, Kalam
            has maintained the ascetic rigour of his personal life, working 18 hours a day
            and practicing the veena. With characteristic modesty, Kalam ascribes the
            greatness of his achievement to the influence of his teachers and mentors. He
            describes the struggles of his boyhood and youth, bringing alive everyday life
            in a small town in South India and the inspirational role of educators. He describes
            the role of visionary Indian scientists, such as Dr Vikram Sarabhai, and of the
            creation of a coordinated network of research institutions. This is also the saga
            of independent Indias struggle for technological self sufficiency and defensive
            autonomy  a story as much about politics, domestic and international, as it is
            about science.</p>
